    Hello stranger! You have just visited my website and you are wondering what it is about? Well, this is my personal portfolio. My (User)name is lunAr-creator. Here you will get to know how I started coding. Furthermore, you will be able to view my most recent projects and tinker with my code!

    <br></br>

    Lets take a trip down memory lane. I started programming all the way back in primary school. Making a ladybug move around a couple of grey carpet tiles to get to a specific destination whilst avoiding objects in its path. I always found it thrilling to watch it work. After that, when I moved to Junior school, things started to get a bit more exciting. My IT teacher decided to introduce us to a platform called 'Scratch'. No doubt you have heard about it. Scratch is a block-based visual programming language and website targeted primarily at children.

    <br></br>

    Next, I took a Scratch coding course in which we learned important aspects of programming, and what i can do with it. Needless to say, i thoroughly enjoyed myself, and made some friends along the way. In the start of secondary school, I started learning C#. 

    <br></br>

    I had learnt a bit of HTML5 and CSS3 in my new school, which is how I have made this website, where you a reading all about me, right now. After that, my Dad started teaching me Python. My favourite programming language so far. 

    <br></br>

    During quarantine, I have made use of all the spare time i have had and sat down and programmed for hours on end. Needless to say, i think it was very fruitful. I have made a UI for a calculator, made some text-based games, solved some problems and made my first python library.

    <br></br>

    So considering all of this, I think I have had some good fun in the world of programming: and i do not intend to stop there. So in the end, i have had quite a good experience. Don't you think? And as Linus Torvalds said: 'Talk is cheap. Show me the code'. So, with that said, why are you still reading this! Go away and checkout my projects :D !
